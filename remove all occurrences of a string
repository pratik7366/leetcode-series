Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        
    size_t pos;
    while ((pos = s.find(part)) != string::npos) {
        s.erase(pos, part.length());
    }
    return s;
    }
};
