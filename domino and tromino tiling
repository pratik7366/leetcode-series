You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

 



//c++ code 

class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int n) {
    
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1), prefix(n + 1);

        dp[0] = 1; 
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        prefix[0] = dp[0];
        prefix[1] = dp[0] + dp[1];
        prefix[2] = prefix[1] + dp[2];

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + 2 * prefix[i - 3]) % MOD;
            prefix[i] = (prefix[i - 1] + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }

        return dp[n];    
    }
};
