Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 



//c++ code class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
       
    if (s.length() != goal.length()) return false;
    string doubled = s + s;
    return doubled.find(goal) != string::npos; 
    }
};
