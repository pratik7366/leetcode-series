you are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.


//c++ code 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    int n = prices.size();
    vector<int> answer(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int discount = 0;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (prices[j] <= prices[i]) {
                discount = prices[j];
                break;
            }
        }
        answer[i] = prices[i] - discount;
    }
    
    return answer;
    }
