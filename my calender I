ou are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.


// c++ code 
class MyCalendar {
public:
    MyCalendar() {
        
    }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
          
        for (auto& event : events) {
            if (max(event.first, start) < min(event.second, end)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        events.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
    
private:
    vector<pair<int, int>> events;

};
