You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.

You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation:

Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first.
Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier.
Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.

 



//c++ code
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getFinalState(vector<int>& nums, int k, int multiplier) {
       
            for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
               
                auto minIt = min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
                *minIt *=
                    multiplier; 
            }
            return nums;
        }
    

};
