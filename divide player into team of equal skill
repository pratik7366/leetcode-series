You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

// c++ code 
class Solution {
public:
    long long dividePlayers(vector<int>& skill) {
        
    sort(skill.begin(), skill.end());
    long long total_chemistry = 0;
    int n = skill.size(), target = skill[0] + skill[n - 1];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        if (skill[i] + skill[n - i - 1] != target) return -1;
        total_chemistry += skill[i] * skill[n - i - 1];
    }
    
    return total_chemistry;

    }
};
