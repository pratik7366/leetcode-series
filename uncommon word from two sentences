A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

 // c++ code


class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> uncommonFromSentences(string s1, string s2) {
        
    unordered_map<string, int> wordCount;
    stringstream ss(s1 + " " + s2);
    string word;
    while (ss >> word) {
        wordCount[word]++;
    }
    vector<string> result;
    for (auto &entry : wordCount) {
        if (entry.second == 1) {
            result.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

};
